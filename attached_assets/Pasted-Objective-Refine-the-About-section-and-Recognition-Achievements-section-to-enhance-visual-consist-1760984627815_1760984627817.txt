Objective:
Refine the About section and Recognition & Achievements section to enhance visual consistency, improve logo visibility, and update recognition details for MetaWorks.

1. About Section — Logo Display Update

Goal:
Ensure both “Supported By” logos appear in perfectly aligned, visually balanced rectangles with a clean white-transparent glass effect.

Implementation Details:

Equal Sizing:

Both logo containers (rectangles) should be equal in height and width for uniform presentation.

Minimum width: 180px; Height: 100px (adjust responsively).

Layout:

Maintain horizontal alignment and equal spacing between both logos.

Center logos vertically and horizontally within each rectangle.

Design Style:

Apply a white-transparent glass gradient (similar to frosted glass).

Use backdrop blur for smooth transparency.

Suggested CSS:

.support-logo-box {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 180px;
  height: 100px;
  border-radius: 12px;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25);
}

.support-logo-box img {
  max-width: 100px;
  max-height: 60px;
  object-fit: contain;
}


Result: A minimal, transparent-glass aesthetic that makes the logos stand out clearly on dark backgrounds.

2. Recognition & Achievements Section — Content and Structure

Goal:
Clean up and modernize the “Recognition & Achievements” section to reflect accurate partnerships and credibility.

Updates Required:

Keep “Graduate 1” and “Tech Champions 5” (or “Code Tech Champions 5”) as the only program recognitions.

Remove any mention of MCIT support.

Under the recognitions, add a “Trusted By” or “Used By Professionals From” subsection featuring logos or names of companies using MetaWorks’ solutions.

Suggested Text:

🏆 Recognitions & Achievements  
- Graduate: Tech Champions 5  
- Recognized under Code Tech Champions 5 by Encode  

💼 Trusted By  
Used by professionals from leading organizations including:  
PwC, STC, Elm, Cognna, and CrowdStrike.


Design Style:

Keep the same dark theme with accent aqua headings.

Use equal-sized transparent-glass boxes for each partner or recognition logo (same as in the “Supported By” section).

Apply consistent spacing and alignment to create a clean, enterprise-grade feel.

3. Outcome

After implementation:

The About section features two perfectly aligned, glass-gradient logo boxes with equal dimensions and clean transparency for visibility.

The Recognition & Achievements section displays only verified recognitions (Graduate 1, Code Tech Champions 5) and a new “Trusted By” subsection highlighting companies using MetaWorks’ solutions.

The entire section maintains MetaWorks’ futuristic dark theme with aqua highlights and frosted glass-style gradients — delivering a consistent, professional brand image.
