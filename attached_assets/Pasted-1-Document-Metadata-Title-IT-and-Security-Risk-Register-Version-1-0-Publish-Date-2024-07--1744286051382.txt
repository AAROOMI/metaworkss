Key Patterns Identified
Strategic Risks (12/47):

Primarily due to missing governance (strategy, policies, committees).

All High Risk before mitigation.

Operational Risks (32/47):

Focus on backups, patching, access controls.

Top Gaps:

No SIEM (Risk #42).

No encryption (Risk #39).

No vulnerability management (Risk #40).

Compliance Risks (3/47):

Data classification, third-party SLAs.
